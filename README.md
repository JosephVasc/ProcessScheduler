# ProcessScheduler
The object is to simulate the scheduler(using a preemptive priority based algorithm) of a simple operating system. The computer will have two resources , a CPU and a disk. There will also be an undetermined number of jobs in the system. Every job will have the following attributes:  job number - these are assigned consecutively and uniquely  priority number - these take values 1 through 4, (1 being the highest, 2, 3, and 4)  maximum time remaining - initially equal to the job’s time estimate Every job will be in exactly one of three states at all times:  executing on the CPU - there is at most one of these jobs  sitting in the ready queue(waiting to run) - jobs will be chosen to move to the cpu based on a
